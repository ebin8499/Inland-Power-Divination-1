ABSTRACT: The Machine Learning is used for predicting the future outputs.In our Project, we use Machine Learning for predicting the Residential Energy Consumption.On the basis of the datasets collected for the previous years , it will predict the energy consumption of the commencing months.In the last few years,the growth in the electrical power demand and the integration of sensing and measuring devices into power distribution grids has led to the efficient use of several smart grids around the world .Efficient power consumption forecasting codings can provide further benefits to the smart grid control process.
